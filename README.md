# IoT-Flood-Detection-using-ESP8266-
IoT Flood Detection using ESP8266.
The name of the project is Flood Detection.
This project is made using the main component which is the ESP8266 NodeMCU.
The components that need to be used are 5 LEDs, 5 resistors (220 ohms), an ultrasonic sensor, a 12C module, an LCD, a 230VAC motor and an ESP8266 NodeMCU board.
